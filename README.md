This is a React based application for Active Campaign.

Dependacies:
* [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) for using Sass files natively
* [classNames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) for classname flexability
* [CSS-Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) for guaranteed CSS Scoping
* [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) for cool way to create a dynamic div

The code could be 'Dryer' I must admit. But the project was made in just a couple hours after work. With a little more time I can come back to this and clean it up to satisfaction and for readability. 

## To Run program

### `npm install`

Once all dependacies have installed run 

### `npm start`
